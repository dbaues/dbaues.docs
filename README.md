# [Hello There!](https://github.com/dbaues/dbaues.docs 'General Kenobi')
___

This repo will house various guides and documentation pieces authored by me, Dan.

> The guides in here are practical guides from my time in the field. As I learn more I will make sure to update these accordingly.

<!--
> Docs is a temporary housing for documentation related to my other projects and upcoming projects.

In the future, many guides will have front facing pages on [dbaues.dev](https://dbaues.dev)  
Currently, the pages can be viewed at [dbaues.github.io/dbaues.docs](https://dbaues.github.io/dbaues.docs)
